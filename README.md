# Qualys QSC Hands-on Training

Qualys QSC Hands-on Training is a `tool` that allows `administrators/trainers` to `provision accounts in a Qualys subscription`.

With these accounts provisioned, many customer accounts can be created and distributed in a short period of time, allowing the trainers to focus on the class and content rather than the setup behind the scenes.
